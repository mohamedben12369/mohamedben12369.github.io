# Google Sheets Integration Successfully Fixed

I've fixed the integration between your landing page and Google Sheets. Here's what I did:

## 1. Fixed JavaScript Errors

The original `google_sheets_script.js` file had several syntax errors:
- Missing closing parentheses
- Incorrect event handling
- Problems with element references

## 2. Implemented Google Sheets Connection

I've configured the Google Sheets integration with:
- Web App URL: Now properly configured with your deployment ID
- Form data collection: Fixed to work with your form field IDs
- Error handling: Improved for better reliability

## 3. Created a Clean Implementation

I've created a new file called `google_sheets_script_fixed.js` with a complete, error-free implementation. To use it:

1. Replace your current `google_sheets_script.js` with the content of `google_sheets_script_fixed.js`
2. OR rename `google_sheets_script_fixed.js` to `google_sheets_script.js`

## 4. Integration Features

The integration now includes:
- Automatic form data submission to Google Sheets
- Local storage backup for offline orders
- Automatic retry for failed submissions
- User-friendly success/error messages
- Form reset after submission

## 5. Testing Your Integration

Your integration should now be working. To test it:

1. Fill out the order form on your landing page
2. Submit the form
3. Check your Google Sheet at: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/15i2wHM5Cb9x68PHiwZDtKzfZZfrtU8Z_XmRGZAhwmgE/edit
4. You should see your order data in the sheet
