# Google Sheets Integration Fixed - Information Not Being Registered

I've fixed the issue with the information not being registered in your Google Sheet. There were several issues with the data transmission method.

## What Was Fixed:

1. **Changed Data Format**:
   - Switched from JSON format to URL-encoded format, which is more compatible with Google Apps Script
   - This solves communication problems between your landing page and Google Sheets

2. **Improved Data Handling**:
   - Enhanced the form data collection and processing
   - Added debug logging to help diagnose any future issues

3. **Updated Script Files**:
   - Created `improved_google_apps_script.js` - contains the new Google Apps Script code
   - Created `google_sheets_script_improved.js` - contains the improved client-side code
   - Replaced your existing `google_sheets_script.js` with the improved version

## How to Complete the Setup:

1. **Update Your Google Apps Script**:
   - Go to your Google Sheet: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1qBi_XX-WKvuXrO04-xOO9oIiMW0A99_1nVs2N330f1E/edit
   - Click on Extensions > Apps Script
   - Delete any existing code and paste the entire content from `improved_google_apps_script.js`
   - Save the project

2. **Deploy the New Script**:
   - Click on Deploy > New deployment
   - Select "Web app" as the type
   - Set Description as "Farnaan Honey Order Form Handler"
   - Set Execute as: "Me" 
   - Set Who has access: "Anyone"
   - Click "Deploy"
   - Authorize the app when prompted
   - Copy the Web App URL that appears

3. **Update Your JavaScript**:
   - Open `google_sheets_script.js`
   - Replace the `GOOGLE_SHEET_WEB_APP_URL` value with the URL you copied in step 2

## Testing the Fix:

1. Open your landing page
2. Fill out the order form completely
3. Submit the form
4. Check your Google Sheet to verify the data appears
5. Open your browser's developer console (F12) to see any debug information

The fixes I've made should resolve the issue with customer information not being registered in your Google Sheet.
